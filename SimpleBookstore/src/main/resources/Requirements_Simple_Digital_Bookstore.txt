Requirement Specification Document: Simple Digital Bookstore
1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the Simple Digital Bookstore, a web application designed to demonstrate a basic e-commerce transaction flow. The primary purpose is to provide a self-contained, lightweight, and single-file web application that can be used as a test case for an automated software development and deployment pipeline.
1.2. Scope
The application's scope is strictly limited to the following:
* Displaying a fixed catalog of two digital books.
* Enabling users to add books to a shopping cart.
* Providing a simplified checkout form for cash-on-delivery orders.
* Generating and displaying a unique Order ID upon successful order placement.
* Storing order data in a persistent format on the server-side.
This project explicitly excludes user authentication, real-time payment processing, a backend administration panel, or any dynamic product management features.
1.3. Target Audience
The primary users of this document are the development, testing, and DevOps agents responsible for implementing, verifying, and deploying the application.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1. Product Catalog Management
* FR-2.1.1: Fixed Catalog: The application shall have a pre-defined, non-editable catalog of two (2) digital books.
* FR-2.1.2: Product Display: Each book shall be displayed with the following attributes:
o title: The full title of the book (string).
o author: The author's name (string).
o imageUrl: A URL to a high-resolution image of the book cover (string).
o description: A concise summary of the book (string).
o price: The price of the book in United States Dollars ($), represented as a floating-point number.
2.2. Shopping Cart Functionality
* FR-2.2.1: Add to Cart: A clearly labeled "Add to Cart" button shall be present on each product display. Clicking this button will add a single instance of the associated book to the shopping cart.
* FR-2.2.2: Cart State Persistence: The contents of the shopping cart shall be stored in localStorage on the client-side, persisting throughout the user's session.
* FR-2.2.3: Cart Summary: A visual summary of the cart (e.g., a cart icon with an item count) shall be displayed prominently on every page.
* FR-2.2.4: Cart View: A dedicated cart page or modal shall display a list of items currently in the cart, along with their quantities and a calculated total price.
* FR-2.2.5: Item Removal: The user shall have the ability to remove an item from the cart.
* FR-2.2.6: Quantity Adjustment: The user shall be able to increase or decrease the quantity of an item in the cart.
2.3. Checkout Process
* FR-2.3.1: Cart Validation: The checkout process shall only be accessible if the shopping cart is not empty. If the cart is empty, the user shall receive a feedback message and be redirected to the product catalog.
* FR-2.3.2: User Information Form: The checkout page shall present a form with the following required fields for the customer's cash-on-delivery order:
o fullName: A text input for the customer's full name.
o shippingAddress: A text area for the customer's shipping address.
o phoneNumber: A text input for the customer's phone number.
* FR-2.3.3: Form Validation: The frontend must validate that all required fields are non-empty before allowing form submission. An appropriate error message shall be displayed to the user for any empty fields.
2.4. Order Placement & Confirmation
* FR-2.4.1: Order Submission: A "Place Order" button shall be available on the checkout form. Clicking this button will trigger a POST request to the backend API.
* FR-2.4.2: Order ID Generation: The backend API shall generate a unique and non-sequential orderId for each new order. The format of the ID must be a string (e.g., ORD-XXXXXXXX).
* FR-2.4.3: Order Data Storage: The backend API shall store the following data for each order in a persistent data store:
o orderId (string)
o items (array of objects, each with title and quantity)
o totalPrice (number)
o customerInfo (object containing fullName, shippingAddress, and phoneNumber)
* FR-2.4.4: Confirmation Display: Upon successful order submission, the user shall be redirected to a new page or a modal shall appear, displaying a confirmation message and the unique orderId.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1. Usability & User Experience
* NFR-3.1.1: Clear Feedback: The application must provide immediate and clear feedback to the user for every action (e.g., "Item added to cart!", "Order placed successfully!").
* NFR-3.1.2: Intuitive Navigation: The flow from product selection to checkout must be intuitive, with clear and accessible buttons and navigation elements.
* NFR-3.1.3: Visual Design: The application shall have a clean, minimalist design with a focus on readability and a pleasant user experience.
3.2. Performance
* NFR-3.2.1: Page Load Time: The initial page load time on a standard desktop browser should not exceed 3 seconds.
* NFR-3.2.2: API Response Time: The API response for order submission shall be returned to the client within 2 seconds.
3.3. Reliability & Data Integrity
* NFR-3.3.1: Data Persistence: The order data stored in the backend must be durable and resistant to server restarts.
* NFR-3.3.2: Error Handling: The application shall handle backend errors gracefully, displaying a user-friendly message (e.g., "Something went wrong. Please try again.") instead of a technical error code.

4. Technical Specifications
4.1. Frontend
* Platform: The application must be delivered as a single HTML file. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be contained within this file.
* Libraries: Standard, lightweight libraries (e.g., Tailwind CSS via CDN) are acceptable for styling. The use of complex frameworks is not required but may be implemented if it contributes to the single-file nature.
* Client-Side State: The shopping cart state shall be managed using the browser's localStorage API.
4.2. Backend
* API: A simple RESTful API is required. Use SpringBoot library.
* Endpoints:
o GET /api/products: Returns a JSON array of the two fixed book products.
o POST /api/orders: Accepts a JSON payload containing the customer and cart details. It will store the order and return a JSON object with the generated orderId.
o Payload: The POST request to /api/orders shall have the following JSON structure:
JSON
{
  "items": [
    { "title": "...", "quantity": 1 },
    { "title": "...", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "customerInfo": {
    "fullName": "...",
    "shippingAddress": "...",
    "phoneNumber": "..."
  }
}
o Response: Upon success, the API shall respond with a 201 Created status code and the following JSON object:
JSON
{
  "orderId": "ORD-123456",
  "message": "Order placed successfully."
}
* Database: A simple JSON file or a similar file-based persistence mechanism will be used to store order data on the server. No complex database setup is required.
